# AndroidProject
This project is an android application that allows the user to track vaccinations of their pets, view the 
campaigns posted by the veterinarian, ask their questions to vet, view the vaccine schedule and past
vaccines. The project provides the user to register, log in with the registered account, and confirm the
registration by e-mail. In addition, the application has an admin panel that allows the veterinarian to
track users' pets, answer their questions and post any campaign.

This project contains a MySQL database, a REST Web Service. The REST Web Service part of this
project was written in PHP. On the mobile side, Android Studio was used as an IDE and it was
developed with Java.
